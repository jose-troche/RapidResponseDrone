# Rapid Response Drone
The Rapid Response Drone (RRD) is a cutting-edge, real-time perception and response unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed for indoor operations. Equipped with cloud-based advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the RRD is capable of recognizing objects as it traverses the space in search of a user-defined target. Upon identification of the target, a laser pointer is fired to tag the object.
